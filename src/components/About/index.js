    <p> Art has always been a massive part of my life. I remember my first art className in 7th grade when my teacher told me that the art I was creating was not good enough. I can still feel how his criticism landed because I felt like such a failure that I never wanted to draw again. I also remember wishing I had taken more time in developing my creative expression because my teacher would’ve understood my artistic vision and I would’ve had a better outcome in that className. 
      Even as a child, I always strived to give my best to my work. When I am in my art form, I feel unstoppable. I’ll stay up for hours painting one individual painting because I don’t want to stop until it is complete.
       
                                        
      This desire comes from personal experience. During my first year of high school, I suffered brain cancer. Before I started college, I suffered from depression and anxiety. Both of these things set me back a bit and made me rethink the whole university situation. Whether I really wanted it? Whether I really needed it? 
      People say when you reach out in pain, you either find God or art. I was in pain and confused about what was happening to me, and when I reached out, I found both God and art. I learned that I could put my own feelings into my art, and I was good enough for me no matter what anyone else said about it. I learned that even though I was going through so much with my health, God had my back to get me through these down times. Hope changes everything.
      After two years of getting better, I realized that, yes, college was not only what I needed but most definitely what I wanted to pursue my ultimate goal in life: art therapy. Today, with the benefit of being a little older and wiser–and fully committed to my journey of creative expression–my mind is in a better place than it was back then when I was struggling. Those years were important, though, in giving me time to think about what I really want to do with my life, what I want out of it, and what I want to give back, most especially to people in need.
      I do not aspire to share with you here a long resume listing all the places where I’ve worked but rather to show you my heart for creating art and helping people through art. Being a human being who cares is enough of a qualification to confidently reach out and help a stranger. To be able to experience this exchange by the same means that helped me so much is the reward itself.
      In the meantime, I’m studying art to feed my love of learning. When I graduate, I want to apply for a teaching course so I can become an art teacher. I want to go back all the way to where it began for me and become a 7th grade art teacher.
      In 2018, I was commissioned to do a glass painting for Marshawn Lynch, a running back for the Seattle Seahawks, and have been working on similar projects ever since. In my spare time, I am on my computer finding photos of friends and family to draw to always keep my artistic muscle working, which has been very successful. 
                             
      I’ve been told my style of art is different from others. Most artists draw and paint on paper as well as canvas, but my preference is glass, plywood, anything that I can find and get my hands on, really. In the graphics art field, I have been able to create my own logo designs for use on posters and textiles, which have stood out and gotten me noticed. I am very serious about art, and my slogan says it all: DHA, Our Fine Arts and your images are soon to be one…
